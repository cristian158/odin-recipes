	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Lasagna is such a delicious crowd-pleaser, and this lasagna recipe is no exception. Enjoy!</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 pound ground sausage (like Neese’s Country Sausage)</li>
		<li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
		<li>   4 ounces red wine</li>
		<li>56 ounces canned crushed tomatoes</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon basil</li>
		<li>3-4 bay leaves</li>
		<li>3/4 teaspoon garlic powder, divided</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
		<li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
		<li>1 egg</li>
		<li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
		<li>1 1/2 pound shredded mozzarella cheese (about 6 cups)</li>
		<li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Brown sausage in large dutch oven or stock pot over medium heat.</li>
		<li>Push browned sausage to the side of pot; add chopped onion and sauté for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
		<li>Stir in red wine and cook for 1 minute.</li>
		<li>Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, bay leaves, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper; stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Continue to simmer over medium for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust seasonings. Reduce heat to low-medium low, cover and continue to cook for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
		<li>Preheat oven to 375-degrees F. Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions; drain, set aside.</li>
		<li>Whisk together egg, ricotta cheese, parsley, remaining 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Set aside.</li>
		<li>Assemble lasagna: Spread about 2 1/2 cups of meat sauce (remember to remove the bay leaves) in the bottom of a 9x13 inch deep baking pan. Arrange 4 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Evenly spread 1/3 (about 2/3 cup) of the egg/ricotta cheese mixture over top. Evenly spread 1 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce evenly over mozzarella. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers. Spread remaining meat sauce on top, and finish by topping with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
		<li>Cover with foil being careful to leave room above cheese to avoid cheese sticking to foil. Bake in 375-degree F oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil, lower temperature to 350-degrees F and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and slightly browned. Cool for about 15-20 minutes before serving.</li>
